Description: the four interesting functions we built during the course improved with some assertions.
    The csv_reader function will read all the csv files in a folder and return a list of data frame (one per csv file).
    the draw_multiple_name function will retrun a ggplot2 graph representing the births of specified names in France between 1900 and 2016.
    the draw_name function will return a ggplot2 graph representing the births of a specified name and sex in france between 1900 and 2016.
    the save_as_csv function is a wrapper for write.csv2 that verifies the file_path is correct.
    the xlsx_reader function will read all the sheets of an excel file and retrun a list of data frames (one per sheet in the file).
